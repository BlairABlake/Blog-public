[{"categories":["Blockchain"],"contents":"Cryptocurrencies are now expanding their popularity ever than before. The price of dogecoin has skyrocketed due to Elon Musk. Web3 has been gaining massive traction from technological enthusiasts. Under the umbrella of the term DeFi, these applications are geared to disrupt the current financial systems.\nBehind the scene is the Blockchain that is working to make those technologies possible. So is it Blockchain that forms the future of the Internet? We can\u0026rsquo;t be certain. But we can be sure that Blockchain has the potential to form the future of the Internet. That\u0026rsquo;s primarily due to the three traits of Blockchain, immutaility, censorship resistance, and data portability, which I\u0026rsquo;m gonna explain the overview and detail in the following sections.\nImmutability The most popular application of blockchain is certainly cryptocurrency. You may know Bitcoin. That\u0026rsquo;s the first and foremost important application of blockchain. At the time of writing 1 BTC is worth about 30000 USD. Backed by nothing why cryptocurrency has so much value (though not every cryptocurrency has so much value)?\nThink in this way. If everyone can easily forge the money without legal sanction, does that money possess value? No, definitely. Things need scarcity to be used as money. That\u0026rsquo;s the reason why Bitcoin has such enormous value. Now we have thougt why immutability is needed at first. Let us now look at how Bitcoin achieved its immutability.\nThe reason behind its scarcity is twofold. One is its distributed nature. Unlike centralized systems, currently dominating the world, blockchain is a decentralized service. Tens of thousands of nodes across the world are running the same blockchain and reaching the same states under the same ruleset. If you were to change one of the transactions, you have to convince tens of thousands of nodes to agree to that change, which is nearly impossible.\nSecond, is its append-only nature. Once a transaction is added to the blockchain, the next block will be chained to that block. Continuing this process if you were to alter transactions in some block, you need to alter every block toward that block, which is practically infeasible.\nCensorship resistance Simply said, censorship resistance means that no single entity has control over the network. Everyone in the network has to follow the same rule.\nThis can be the chief property for some people because no one including the government and organization cannot alter the blockchain. No one is an exception. This frees us from confiscation.\nData portability The idea of data portability is that there should be practically no friction in the user\u0026rsquo;s porting data from one service to another.\nThink of how much control we have over our data. We don\u0026rsquo;t have control in most cases. It is large companies that possess our data. But large companies in the technology and finance space have not been great stewards of data. They have been breached and hacked. See this list of data being breached. Worse than this is that they have often attempted to conceal these breaches.\nLeveraging the Blockchain we can own our data.\n","permalink":"http://blairablakeblog.s3-website-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/blog/blockchain-traits/","tags":["Blockchain","Bitcoin","Ethereum"],"title":"Three Key Traits of Blockchain Explained"},{"categories":["Android And Gaming"],"contents":"We have come full circle.\n","permalink":"http://blairablakeblog.s3-website-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/blog/post-1/","tags":["Photos","Game","React","Python","New"],"title":"How To Use Checklists To Improve Your UX"},{"categories":["HTML \u0026 CSS"],"contents":"Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 Heading 4 Heading 5 Heading 6 Emphasis Emphasis, aka italics, with asterisks or underscores.\nStrong emphasis, aka bold, with asterisks or underscores.\nCombined emphasis with asterisks and underscores.\nStrikethrough uses two tildes.
