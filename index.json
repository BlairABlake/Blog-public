[{"categories":["mathematics"],"contents":"The art and craft of problem solving by Paul Zeitz is highly recommended for those who want to get started in competitive mathematical problems as well as who are looking for the opportunities to enhance problem-solving skills in general. This book begins with the mindset of a problem-solver followed by strategies, tactics, and topic-specific chapters. This book contains too many good points to tell you right now so I\u0026rsquo;m going to tell you how I changed before and after reading this book.\nThe Mindset In Chapter 2, this book teaches us psychological strategies. This is, in short, a \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t give up\u0026rdquo; mindset. You may doubt that this is included in a problem-solving book, but this turned out to be so helpful. A good problem solver doesn\u0026rsquo;t give up! Just having this mindset can be dull. Good problem solver varies each attempt. First try this strategy and then this and then this, and then \u0026hellip; etc, for example. This mindset set me to challenge a difficult problem even if it is a problem from Putnam Competition or IMO.\nTactical View This book presents four tactics, symmetry, the extreme principle, the pigeonhole principle, and the invariance principle. After reading each chapter, you may be surprised by the dramatic differences in your point of view.\nTactics are somewhat versatile tools, applicable to almost every problem. Combined with psychological strategies, these tactics can revolutionalize your problem-solving skills. When I read this chapter, I was sure I\u0026rsquo;m a problem solver.\nTopic-Specific Skills Up to this point, this book teaches us general techniques of problem-solving. However, we cannot be a master of problem-solving without knowledge. At this point, I could challenge any problem, but I was missing the wisdom of mathematics indeed. The knowledge can not only simplify the problem but also deepen our insight into mathematics.\nTopics included in this book are algebra, combinatorics, number theory, combinatorics, and calculus. Each chapter is subdivided into smaller topics, each of which is essential knowledge of mathematics in general. After completing these topics, I became more interested in mathematics and its beauty as well as its elegance.\n","permalink":"http://blairablakeblog.s3-website-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/blog/theartofproblemsolving-bookreview/","tags":["mathematics","learning","problem-solving"],"title":"The Art And Craft of Problem Solving --Book Review"},{"categories":["self-help"],"contents":"At the time of this writing, I was a high school student. I was eager to learn many things, mathematics, physics, chemistry, algorithm, HTML, cloud, machine learning, blockchain, etc. That amount is way out of my capacity. But my eagerness to do all these things leads to the invention of a new way of multitasking. This is what I\u0026rsquo;m gonna tell you today, the art of multitasking.\nIntroduction Multitasking is usually considered non-effective or simply bad, not helpful. I was sure that was true. Multitasking lower productivity. You cannot focus on multiple things simultaneously. I was thinking so. But my enthusiasm doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop me from multitasking. I was studying mathematics and algorithm at the same time because time is too precious to do all the things I want. I needed help. I needed a way to get out of this situation. It\u0026rsquo;s exactly this time that I bumped into a concept called transfer learning.\nTransfer Learning Transfer learning is generally a machine learning technique, in which an AI that has learned a specific task is used to train an AI to do another similar task (Machine learning is a subset of AI, for those who didn\u0026rsquo;t heard of Machine learning feel free to think of it as AI). As soon as I heard this concept, it clicked what was needed for me. That\u0026rsquo;s thinking of connections between tasks. Thinking as if everything is connected somehow significantly improves my productivity. Below I\u0026rsquo;m gonna tell you the step to a new version of multitasking.\nStep 1 Stop multitasking. You are maybe confused about this absurd step because I titled this article the art of Multitasking. But a crucial step to improve your multitasking is to stop multitasking. Stop multitasking, I should repeat, and focus on the one thing you are doing.\nStep 2 Take a short break, then think of connections to other tasks, even if there are no obvious connections. When you can\u0026rsquo;t find the connections, impose connections. How can you find a connection between emailing and learning physics? That\u0026rsquo;s ridiculous you may think. It\u0026rsquo;s not so much nonsense. In emailing, you compose a sentence given the information you need to tell, the information of a person to which you will send an email. That is transforming the given information into a sentence. In solving physics problems, you need to find a route to reach the goal by transforming given information or applying theorems. There you find a connection. Both tasks are about interpreting the information and transforming or applying the information to reach a goal.\nStep 3 Continue the task, but apply the knowledge of other tasks to which you find connections in step 2.\n","permalink":"http://blairablakeblog.s3-website-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/blog/art-of-multitasking/","tags":["self-help","learning"],"title":"The Art of Multitasking"},{"categories":["Blockchain"],"contents":"Cryptocurrencies are now expanding their popularity ever than before. The price of dogecoin has skyrocketed due to Elon Musk. Web3 has been gaining massive traction from technological enthusiasts. Under the umbrella of the term DeFi, these applications are geared to disrupt the current financial systems.\nBehind the scene is the Blockchain that is working to make those technologies possible. So is it Blockchain that forms the future of the Internet? We can\u0026rsquo;t be certain. But we can be sure that Blockchain has the potential to form the future of the Internet. That\u0026rsquo;s primarily due to the three traits of Blockchain, immutaility, censorship resistance, and data portability, which I\u0026rsquo;m gonna explain the overview and detail in the following sections.\nImmutability The most popular application of blockchain is certainly cryptocurrency. You may know Bitcoin. That\u0026rsquo;s the first and foremost important application of blockchain. At the time of writing 1 BTC is worth about 30000 USD. Backed by nothing why cryptocurrency has so much value (though not every cryptocurrency has so much value)?\nThink in this way. If everyone can easily forge the money without legal sanction, does that money possess value? No, definitely. Things need scarcity to be used as money. That\u0026rsquo;s the reason why Bitcoin has such enormous value. Now we have thougt why immutability is needed at first. Let us now look at how Bitcoin achieved its immutability.\nThe reason behind its scarcity is twofold. One is its distributed nature. Unlike centralized systems, currently dominating the world, blockchain is a decentralized service. Tens of thousands of nodes across the world are running the same blockchain and reaching the same states under the same ruleset. If you were to change one of the transactions, you have to convince tens of thousands of nodes to agree to that change, which is nearly impossible.\nSecond, is its append-only nature. Once a transaction is added to the blockchain, the next block will be chained to that block. Continuing this process if you were to alter transactions in some block, you need to alter every block toward that block, which is practically infeasible.\nCensorship resistance Simply said, censorship resistance means that no single entity has control over the network. Everyone in the network has to follow the same rule.\nThis can be the chief property for some people because no one including the government and organization cannot alter the blockchain. No one is an exception. This frees us from confiscation.\nData portability The idea of data portability is that there should be practically no friction in the user\u0026rsquo;s porting data from one service to another.\nThink of how much control we have over our data. We don\u0026rsquo;t have control in most cases. It is large companies that possess our data. But large companies in the technology and finance space have not been great stewards of data. They have been breached and hacked. See this list of data being breached. Worse than this is that they have often attempted to conceal these breaches.\nLeveraging the Blockchain we can own our data.\n","permalink":"http://blairablakeblog.s3-website-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/blog/blockchain-traits/","tags":["Blockchain","Bitcoin","Ethereum"],"title":"Three Key Traits of Blockchain Explained"}]
